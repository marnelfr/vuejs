Once installed, we've got the **vue** command that 
can be used to created our project

```
While creating our project,
- I selected manually the features

  - Choose Vue version
  - Babel
  - Router
  - Vuex
  - Linter / Formatter
- Next, I selected 3.x (Preview)
- I used history mode for the router
